<p class="about-content">
  Growing up in South Africa, I developed an appreciation for wildlife and the natural world. Moving to Europe at the age of 15,
  I pursued biology in highschool and continued that passion in university,
   where I completed a Bsc. in animal management, majoring in wildlife management. After graduating I joined a veterinary company where I
   worked in admin and was tasked with managing the diary. This company was somewhat new, and did not have a large
   marketing / social media presence. I took it upon myself to develop a marketing framework and to
   promote the company online. For this, I needed to know more about web development. And so the journey to becoming
   a web developer began!
